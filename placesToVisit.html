                        in the
                        State of Gujarat in India. The lake was rebuilt with stone masonry in the 18th Century. The
                        water in this
                        lake remains in it for the whole year. A concrete wall surrounds the lake on which the people
                        use to sit. A
                        120 feet (37 m) tall statue of lord Shiva built by Vadodara mahanagar Seva Sadan stands in the
