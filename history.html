            Vadodara is situated on the banks of River Vishwamitri. The name of this river was derived from the name of a great Saint Vishwamitra.

            During 9th Century, Present  Akota was known as Ankottaka,  which was a little town and was famous for Jainism located on banks of River Vishwamitri.  In 5th and 6th Century A.D.,  Some of  bronze Images are still found in Baroda Museum. Architecture findings also date Baroda back to this time.
            
            The early trade settlers made an entry in 812 A.D.. The imperial Baroda province was mainly ruled by Hindu Kings till the year 1297. Chalukya Dynasty took over the Gupta Empire by fierce battle after intense rivalry. After then, it was taken over by Solanki Rajputs. Tehn, Muslim rule was spread across India and reins of Power were then snatched by Sultans of Delhi. The city was ruled for a long time by these Sultans, until they were easily overthrown by the Mughal emperors. During this time, Maratha Gaekwads made an entry into this region  and began  their reputable reign. They made Vadodara as their capital.
            
            The Glorious History of the Gaekwad’s began when Maratha General Pilaji Rao Gaekwad conquered Songadh from the Mughals in year 1726. The Mughal rule came to an End in Year 1732, when Maratha General Pilaji Rao Gekwad intensified the Maratha campaigns in South Gujarat and carved out a Kingdom for his lineage. Son & Succesor of Pilaji Rao Gekwad – Damajirao, defeated the Mughal Armies and conquered Baroda State in Year 1734. Slowly, the Gekwad successors intensified the degree of their hold over more areas of Gujarat, which made them most Powerful Rulers in the region. The Geakwad’s ruled the Kingdom until Indian Independence in Year 1947.
            
            In Year 1875, during the enigmatic rule of Maharaja Sayajirao III, it was considered as the Golden Period, as it was an Era of great progress and achievements in all fields.
